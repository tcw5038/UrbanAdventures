# Urban Adventures

## Node Capstone project at Thinkful

## Technologies used:
* Front End - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery
* Back End - Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mocha


## Summary of functionality:
This app functions like a digital record of a user's urban travel experiences. Users can record cities that they have traveled to with images, tags, and summaries. These cities can be changed and deleted at the user's convenience and are stored in their own account. Additionally, using Google Maps, users are able to see their pins visually on a map.
